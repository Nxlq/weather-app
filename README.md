This project's purpose was to build something that would provide practice using asynchronous coding fundamentals when interacting with an api.
While creating this weather app I gained experience using async/await as well as promises/.then and familiarized myself with their workflow/functionality.
Another important takeaway was the experience gained with using chart.js and learning how CDN's can be used within your code.
The project's core functionality is there and has plenty of room for endless optimization but it is complete and served its learning purpose well.
